# Beta Lactamase Inhibitor Prediction
This is an open-sourced project based on the dataset that is given by Dr. Chanin aka The Data Professor. Basically, this project will try to predict which compound that can be used as the Beta-Lactamase inhibitor. Until now, I got the random forest as the best model, and the SMOTE sampling has been applied to the data itself.
